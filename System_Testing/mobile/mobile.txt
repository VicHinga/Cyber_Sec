		Types of Mobile Apps:

1. Native Mobile Apps
	Apps are usually created for a specific platform like Android or iOS.

2. Hybrid Apps
	Apps are usually created for multiple platforms from from a single codebase.

3. Progressive Web Apps (PWA)
	 Software app based on the web that will install on a system.


 Mobile app Security Risks:-

1. Insecure Data Storage < sensitive info should be kept safe >
2. Untrusted Inputs <  >
3. Insecure Communication <  >
4. Insufficient Cryptography <  >
5. Code Obfuscation < transforming the source code of an application to hinder reverse engineering >


  Parameters to test while performing Mobile Application Penetration Testing

1. Architecture, design, and threat modeling: <  >
2. Network communication: < testing how the data travels over networks >
3. Data storage and privacy: < storage of sensitive data >
4. Authentication and session management: < testing for session management issues such as session expiration on password change >
5. Misconfiguration errors in code or build settings: <  >


  Methodology of Mobile App Penetration Testing:

Step 1. Preparation and Discovery:

  Understanding the design and architecture of the application.
  Understanding network-level data flow of the application
  Using OSINT to gather data

Step 2. Analysis, Assessment, and Evaluation:

  Static and dynamic analysis
  Architecture analysis
  Reverse engineering
  Analysis of file system
  Inter application communication

Step 3. Exploitation:

   Testing the application with simulated real-world attacks to understand how it will behave when an attack occurs. Example: reverse shell or root exploit.

Step 4. Reporting:

   Prepare a detailed report of the attacks performed.
