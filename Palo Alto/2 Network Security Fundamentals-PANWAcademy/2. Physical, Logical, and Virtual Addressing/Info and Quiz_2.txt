• Recognize decimal, binary, and hexadecimal conversion methods. 
• Describe the structure and fields of an IP header.
• Identify the structure and basic format of IPV4 and IPV6 addresses.
• Subnet an IPV4 Class C addressing scheme.
• Configure and test a virtual IP address on a firewall interface.
• Review the four DHCP process messages and Network Address Translation (NAT).
• Setup the firewall as a DHCP server and test the DHCP client.
